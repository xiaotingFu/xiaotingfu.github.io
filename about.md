## About Me

I am a recent graduate from NCSU and is currently looking for full-time SDE jobs. I have a solid understanding of programming languages including Python, C# and Java, SQL and Node.js and is familiar with frameworks like MEAN, and .Net. I also have experience in building web application to collect speech/video data using Node.js, RecordRTC and Socket.io.  I also has experience in building an Android application for lifelogging for older adults. During that process, I communicated with a group of older adults live near her campus to collect their opinions about the mobile phone application and build the app that is easy and simple for them to use. 

I am especially passionate about working on solutions from a full-stack standpoint because by understanding user requirements as well as overall system architecture thoroughly, I can deliver products with both great performance and easy-to-use experience. Learning new technologies and incorporate them with what I have been doing always excited me. Keeping learning and being curious always refreshes my mind with better designs and solutions.
